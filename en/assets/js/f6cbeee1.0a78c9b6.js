In computer vision and other rapidly evolving sectors, Python is considered the go-to option for many researchers when they conduct fast algorithm prototyping and verification, especially in scenarios like image pre-processing and model training. OpenCV, a popular image processing library, also provides a Python encapsulation so that users can write Python code to call underlying C++ algorithms and get performance gains."}]}')}}]);
