To make your reading experience less tedious, we will take the beauty filters and the HDR effect of the popular console game *Ghost of Tsushima* as examples to elaborate on image processing algorithms, including the Gaussian filter, the bilateral filter, and the bilateral grid, in ascending order of difficulty. You are recommended to write code as you read on, and we're sure you will not close this page empty-handed whether you are familiar with image processing or not. We hope that this article can serve you well, and we look forward to your feedback, positive or negative :).

## Introduction

Python is one of the most widely used languages for image processing. In computer vision and other rapidly evolving sectors, Python is considered the go-to option for many researchers when they conduct fast algorithm prototyping and verification, especially in scenarios like image pre-processing and model training. OpenCV, a popular image processing library, also provides a Python encapsulation so that users can write Python code to call underlying C++ algorithms and get performance gains.
